# Files > Names

These `.names` files contains a collection of names that are 
randomly picked for naming various entities. For example, naming moons,
planets, and stars.

The format in these files are simple. Every line is a new entry. 
Any trailing whitespaces are removed, and lines beginning with the `#`
character are ignored: comments.

*Please note*: many of these files contain list of names from websites. While the names
are not copywritable, I just ask you inlude the URLs of where these names 
were retrieved.
